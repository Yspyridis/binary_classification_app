8,"So, I have these piano lessons with my piano teacher and she has, she also does this choir, choir, and they were asked to perform in front of like this crowd of people, ’cos it’s like a competition thing; and I normally do piano competitions in there so I was quite familiar with the area.

23,"OK, so it was my housemate and she had come back from a night out in the morning, and she had no phone.  and she had been in contact with the Police but they weren’t very helpful, and they just said they couldn’t trace a phone.  But uh, we had the ‘Find my iPhone’ app, and we used the details on my computer to trace her phone, and we managed to locate it     , to somewhere within Portsmouth and We then told the Police and the Police accompanied us to the location, and we managed to get her phone back.  Yeah.",1

31,"Well it happened just after I had finished work, so it was around about five o’clock in the evening when I was just leaving the office.    , and I came out and I saw two people having an altercation, something heated but I couldn’t hear; and then all of a sudden one of them whipped out a long pipe of some description and hit the other one across the head, and ran.

33,"So, I was going to New York for the weekend and we landed in...  Think it was JFK but I’m not a hundred percent, and we were waiting for about an hour for the bag to come through the carousel, and it turns out that they never put it on the plane.  It was just sitting on the tarmac in London, so we ended up having to kind of get things together; we were only there for the weekend.  So it basically meant that I had to wear the same clothes for like three days in June in New York which is horrific.  and it was just a bit of a nightmare, in the sense that we didn’t actually get the bag back until the night before we were leaving, and we were told that we would get it back maybe the morning of the day after we were there.  yeah. ",1
36,"So   , my older brother had been invited to a wedding over there, a friend of his he’d met online, and he was a little concerned about going there because he’d like never met them before.  So he was like ‘Could you come?’ and I was like ‘I don’t really want to but I mean it’s New York’, so I went.  And when we got there we were picking up our bags and I was waiting and waiting and waiting, and it didn’t turn up and I suppose I was really upset about it, and then.  Yeah, for most of the week I had to basically borrow his clothes until I got my bag back, so but luckily I did manage to get it back before the wedding, so that was, that was nice.",0
37,"OK.  So it was the first night that I properly went out with all my friends, and I hadn’t really drunk a lot before, like I’d had fruit ciders at home and stuff but nothing   like exciting. So we went out and had pre-drinks as, as it’s called these days and that was fine, that was OK.  I was a bit dizzy after that but nothing major.  And then actually going ‘out’ out, don’t remember a lot, but I remember that my friends that I cried because I dropped my cardigan in the road and that I was so tired when we got back that I just fell on my friend’s bed and they had to help me back to my room which was disastrous. I didn’t throw up though, which was very lucky because I don’t   like vomit.  I have a phobia of vomit so I was anxious Yeah, that’s   ",0
43,"Yeah.  I was really excited because it was my second time on holiday since I was four, and it was for my eighteenth birthday party, which I didn’t know.  So I thought I was going to Holland just for like, with my friends to meet up, and when I got there – I went on June the fifth to June the tenth – and when I got there it was just a normal, and then my birthday was on June the sixth. and then they threw a big party for me in a mansion and it was so nice.  And yeah  ",0
44,"Yeah.  So obviously it was in December, and it was obviously around the time of like Christmas and stuff, and then my family was having a really hard time and I just felt a little bit lost.  Like, I didn’t know really where I was going, what I was doing and things like that, and I wasn’t really getting any support from my family, so I was like ‘Why not go somewhere?’  So I spoke to my friend about it and she was sort of feeling the same so we looked it up; and I just really needed the time to reflect on everything that was going on, and then hopefully move forward and understand why I’m here, sort of thing.  So it was just a   adventure sort of, to find who I am with my friend, and just  Yeah, that’s about it ",0
45,"We were upstairs.  My friend was dancing close to someone else, he kept knocking into him, and obviously we’d all had a bit to drink.  So the guy turned round and pushed him, we all just left it at that to start off with, and then this kept happening, you could see they were always staring over at him.  So then them two went at each other, my friend got punched in the face.  So then when everyone was trying to break them away it started, everyone just started to fight each other as it probably would happen, or it does happen.  the bouncers pulled us away said ‘Any more, you’re out’, and it just kept, people just kept going at each other so they kicked us out.  And we went different ways, we went to a kebab shop, ordering food, same people walked in and obviously no security guards or anything, so went at each other again. ",1
49,"Yeah it, it was, I think it’s what, it was all about the social environment from that period of time, because everything was based on   , men’s right.  Women, women were not in, not, were not directly int, introduced in the society as from their kind of    w, women were really. abused in that period of time.  That was pretty bad because I, I, I remember movie scene when a mother has to cut her hair to help her daughter, and also remove her teeth to pay for the rent of the house.

She was looking for directions to the Highclere Castle, this is a Newbury, and I spoke to her for a bit ’cos I’m not very good at remembering faces.  So I was like ‘I know you from somewhere, but where do I know you from?’  And then someone just came in, and she was like ‘Oh, it’s Serena Williams’, and I was like ‘Oh my God, it’s Serena Williams!’  I didn’t even notice that I was speaking to her the entire time.
